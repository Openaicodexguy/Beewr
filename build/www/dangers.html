    <h1>The Dangers of BonziWORLD</h1>
    <p>The newest variation of BonziWORLD Revived was meant to be for private use, but due to the discord server members really wanting it back it has been decided that it had to be put back online again. It is now public once again, however the members decided that it had to come back, not Seamus.</p>
    <p>Since 2021, BonziWORLD has become slightly unplayable due to people being rude to others. This README page will show you the darkest side of bonziworld's community.</p>
    <p>Currently, the popular server everyone is using is bonzi.lol. However, the site has potentially offensive content. The server's discord server has been violating numerous TOS and Guidelines, yet nobody is reporting them.</p>
    <p>Bonzi.lol encourages illegal activites such as doxxing, and will tell their cybermob to harass innocent users.</p>
    <p>Because of an former admin of our server being a dick to nearly everybody, he decided to conquer it and make it the most toxic community in the world, making the website extremely aggressive, unfriendly, and will harass anybody.</p>
    <p>The owner of bonzi.lol's name is Fune, also known as Bluefong. It is known that everyone named after a children's youtube channel 'Pinkfong' are shitty people. Well who would've guessed, because Fune is a shitty person already.</p>
    <p>A former 'friend' of Seamus recently went against him in Janurary 2022, constantly accusing him of things he didn't do, and started making cringe videos out of him and would harass him non stop. He has created a Google Docs document named 'Enough is enough', which 'exposes' seamus and his 'actions', most of them being minor and falsified rumors of him being a paedophile. To this day, he hasn't changed a single bit, still having mental issues and has now joined bonzi.lol's cybermob.</p>
    <p>
        Bonzi.lol contains a server that has doxxed information of innocent inviduals, like Seamus. and nobody seems to care about their lives being in potential danger. The people of bonzi.lol are no-lifers and don't give a shit about your feelings. One really simple thing and you will get doxxed by them instantly. Your IP address is taken from the logs of bonzi.lol and will be used for malicious purposes, like doxxing. It's also a literal shock website, by the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is crazy how nobody knows the dangers of the community right now. Nobody seems to care about people having their lives in danger. They might get swatted by the BozoWORLD users. One of them might even commit suicide. Only a few amount of people know about the situation we're dealing with.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Learning how to use BonziWORLD and it's forks in 2022 and later</h3>
    Okay, now we got some of the info shown to you, we will show you how to use any bonziworld website, and how to avoid these mean people from harassing you.

    <h4>Using BonziWORLD</h4>
    Try to avoid all public rooms and only share your room id to people you trust. If you are planning to stream and/or record, censor the room id by using inspect element so the attackers can't join your room and harass you.
    If you are under attack by these inviduals, you can create an new identity.
    <br>
    <h5>Creating your new identity</h5>
    Delete all of your accounts except valuable ones like your steam account, and try to make up a new nickname. It must not be related to your interests, your name and anything that is related to you and your family.
    Keep your brand new discord account private. Only share the tag of your new account to your friends and stay off of public discord servers.

    <h3>About the BonziWORLD Encylopedia Dramatica Page</h3>
    <p>
      All pages on the drama wiki are satire. Don't worry too much about it.
    </p>
    <h2>Final Words</h2>
    <p>
      I think BonziWORLD's Community has devolved into degeneracy and pure toxicity at this point. They will harass any children and will give no mercy. I still kind of hate the community because of those people. They will never be poltie ever, which is really unfortunate. Stay off of bonzi.lol and move to this version of BonziWORLD for a much better experience. And also if they ever say that they're the most powerful server, better than erik's or any other server, or the bonziworld community is great, they're lying. They turned it into shit. I must also say though, they're also making fake screenshots out of me saying "grrr eem so mad im going to docks fune" but in reality it's just an edited image of my conversation with Cosmic. They're also invading my personal stuff and using them to leak personal information about me. They are no lifers who are destroying this community. I want YOU to spread the word. If you have discord, send this page to your friends.
